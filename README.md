This is a mod on Voron 2.4 LCD Module "mini12864_case_front" & "mini12864_case_rear" to fit Mellow FLY Mini V1.0 12864 Display Screen.

The module design is by Voron Design Team (Mod based on Release v2.4r1 - 5th of May 2021), nothing new is created.

The goal of this mod is to maintain the original look and installation procedure.

## Changes made are below

*mini12864_case_rear*
1. Slight relocate mounting holes position
2. Slight relocate cutout position for EXP1 and EXP2 connector

*mini12864_case_front*
1. Slight relocate screw holes position
2. Slight relocate LCD module cutout position
3. Relocate the encoder and reset button cutout as the position of this mini12864 is very different


## Installation

Install as per Voron Aseembly Manual, you will still need the original **_mini12864_spacer.stl_**
