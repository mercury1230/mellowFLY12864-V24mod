# mellowFLY12864-V24mod
This is a mod on Voron 2.4 LCD Module "mini12864_case_front" & "mini12864_case_rear" to fit Mellow FLY Mini V1.0 12864 Display Screen.

The module design is by Voron Design Team (Mod based on Release v2.4r1 - 5th of May 2021), nothing new is created.

The goal of this mod is to maintain the original look and installation procedure.

## Changes made are below

*mini12864_case_rear*
1. Slight relocate mounting holes position
2. Slight relocate cutout position for EXP1 and EXP2 connector

*mini12864_case_front*
1. Slight relocate screw holes position
2. Slight relocate LCD module cutout position
3. Relocate the encoder and reset button cutout as the position of this mini12864 is very different


## Printing & Installation

Print using standard Voron parts print settings.
**_please note that I did not orient the STLs for printing position, you need to rotate it._**

Install as per Voron Aseembly Manual, you will still need the original **_mini12864_spacer.stl_**


## Notes
My LCD module PCB came with the wrong type of encoder (it have longer shaft).
As per advised by Mellow Team the current revision will not have the same problem anymore.
